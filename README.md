# Smart Host Coding Challenge

Build a room occupancy optimization tool for one of our hotel clients! Our customer has a certain number of free rooms each night, as well as potential guests that would like to book a room for that night. 
Please build a small API that provides an interface for hotels to enter the numbers of Premium and Economy rooms that are available for the night and then tells them immediately how many rooms of each category will be occupied and how much money they will make in total.
